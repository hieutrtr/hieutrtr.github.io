# 💥 After the AI Boom: Where I’m Putting My Energy (and Where You Might Too)

I’ve been watching the AI boom with a mix of excitement and unease.
The excitement is obvious — we’ve never had this much compute power, this many open models, or this much creative potential in one field.

But the unease comes from the scale of it all.
Hundreds of billions of dollars are flowing into GPUs, model training, and data centers.
Meanwhile, the revenue from real AI products — the kind that actually sustain themselves — is still small.

It reminds me of every infrastructure bubble before: the dot-com era, the crypto rush, even the solar overbuild of the 2010s.
The same rhythm: fast money, too many players, too little discipline.
Eventually, the hype fades, the easy funding disappears, and only the systems that deliver real value survive.

So, if I were you — and I kind of am, just another software engineer trying to think clearly in noisy times — here’s exactly where I’d invest my effort right now.

## ⚙️ 1. I’m Focusing on Optimizing LLMs for Cost

Every company that jumped into AI is going to wake up to one reality: running models is expensive.
Compute, memory, and inference latency are real costs — and most people don’t measure them until it’s too late.

That’s why the engineers who can make AI cheaper to run will be the ones everyone wants to hire.

I’m learning about:

- Model distillation, quantization, and pruning
- Mixed precision and GPU scheduling
- Balancing cloud vs. edge vs. on-prem inference

The competitive edge isn’t in building a bigger model anymore — it’s in running smaller models more intelligently.
That’s where margin, scale, and long-term sustainability come from.

## 🧠 2. I’m Going Deep Into Architecture and Systems

Most AI builders today live entirely above the stack — they wire up APIs, connect wrappers, and call it “integration.”
But when the bubble cools, the real differentiator will be who actually understands the system underneath.

I’m talking about:

- Distributed systems and data flow
- Cache strategy, message queues, and concurrency
- Failure recovery and observability at scale

When something breaks — and it always will — companies won’t look for someone who can prompt a model.
They’ll look for someone who can fix the system.

> Depth beats speed. The boom rewarded quick demos; the next era will reward real engineering.

## 💡 3. I’m Paying Attention to AI That Ties Into Real Revenue

Not everything needs a new model.
The real money will be in connecting AI to existing businesses — logistics, healthcare, education, insurance, finance.

That’s where workflows are repetitive, data-rich, and already funded.

I’m asking:

- Can this AI product save time or reduce cost for a business?
- Can it automate part of a process people already pay for?
- Can it create measurable output, not just “AI magic”?

Because at the end of the day, “cool” doesn’t pay bills — ROI does.

## 🧩 4. I’m Building for Multi-Model Coordination

I don’t believe in “one model to rule them all.”
The future will be many models working together — small, large, open, private — orchestrated by logic, memory, and context.

That’s the space I’m most excited about right now: how to coordinate reasoning models, retrieval systems, and tools into a single intelligent workflow.

I’m experimenting with:

- LangGraph, DSPy, and agentic orchestration frameworks
- Managing multi-model pipelines with cost and latency constraints
- Designing trustable systems, not just fancy demos

The big opportunity isn’t in training the next GPT — it’s in building the ecosystem where many GPTs can cooperate.

## 🧪 5. I’m Getting Serious About Synthetic Data and Evaluation

As AI moves deeper into real work, we’ll need to measure it like we measure any system.
That means testing, benchmarking, and continuous evaluation — not just vibes.

Synthetic data generation is key here.
It lets us test rare edge cases, stress-test logic, and debug hallucinations before they reach production.

If you can design pipelines that evaluate models automatically — precision, recall, reasoning, and bias — you’ll be part of the new “QA for AI.”
And that’s a huge, unsolved space.

---

## ⚖️ What I’m Letting Go Of

- Fancy wrappers with no measurable impact
- AI demos that don’t connect to revenue
- Copying prompts instead of designing systems
- Ignoring cost, power, or latency in architecture decisions

Those are bubble behaviors.
They might get likes, but they won’t survive the correction.

---

## 🌱 What I’m Building Toward

- Tools that make AI cheaper, auditable, and reliable
- Frameworks for multi-model coordination
- Evaluation systems for continuous measurement
- Integrations where AI actually touches business metrics

That’s not glamorous work — but it’s real, it’s defensible, and it’s what will matter when the hype cycle resets.

## 🧭 Final Thought

If you’ve read this far, here’s the short version:

> Learn to optimize LLMs for cost.
> Deepen your architectural and system thinking.
> Integrate AI into real revenue.
> Build for coordination and measurement.

That’s where I’m putting my energy.
Because when the noise fades — and it will — those who can make AI efficient, measurable, and useful will define the next chapter of this industry.
